These files come from the tensorflow repository at the path tensorflow/core/framework/ (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/framework). They must be updated manually.

NOTE: You must also update the paths in tensor so that they import the other files relative to their own directory (i.e. replace the tensorflow/core/framework/... paths with ...).
